# License

Always choose an appropiate license for your project.  

In Github, if you don't choose a license you keep the rights on your project by default, but is better to be explicit about it.  

Go to [Choose a License](https://robertovillarejo.github.io/2017/09/18/choosealicense.com) to clarify doubts.
